Fivereborn Webmanager
==============

How to use:
--------------

Edit the index.php like you need it. Change sitename and add servers. Upload it to your webserver and have fun.


IMPORTANT:
--------------

You can integrate it in you own website or build around that script but its completly insecure by default. Everybody could just google your site and ban players. You MUST add some sort of security feature to it, like a login system.
Again, please dont use it like it is now!!!!

Sidenote:
--------------
I made a whole webinterface completly for SidewaysInc servers and this is just a "ripoff". If you cant develop yourself but want more functions (user-, mod-, or some other management-functions) you can ask me to develop them. But that wont be for free because i have to invest my private time for it. Well, this is for free and i hope you have fun with it :)
